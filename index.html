				<td>Hello, my name is Richard Benjamin and I am currently a student at Mansfield University.
				I was brought up in a small town named Towanda in northern Pennsylvania, 
				and went to Towanda Area Jr/Sr Highschool. 
				Growing up I have always had a profound love for computers, and always was around them growing up. 
				So it only made sense to chase a career in a field with computers. 
			
				My goal in life is too learn as much as possible about computers. 
				One day I hope to work at a big company either coding or doing something related to computers or math. 
				On the side I would like to pursue a partial career in YouTube. But that is just a dream for now.
				</td>
				<td>
				Java, Java script, HTML, Python, Linux, Git, MySQL, Vim, Nano B, 
				CSS, JSP, Java Servlets, MVC, HTML5
				</td>
				<td>
				You can contact me at benjaminrj02@mounties.mansfield.edu for more information.
